# Genetic Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the "Genetic Algorithm Playground" repository! This repository serves as a platform for studying, implementing, and experimenting with various objective functions commonly used in optimization problems, as well as exploring the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in solving these challenges.

## About

As a graduate student pursuing an MSc in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, I am passionate about harnessing computational intelligence techniques for problem-solving. This repository showcases my journey in understanding and implementing objective functions and Genetic Algorithms, demonstrating their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Objective Functions**: Explore a collection of implemented objective functions, including both unimodal and multimodal optimization problems, to gain insights into their behaviors and characteristics.

- **Genetic Algorithm Implementations**: Discover Python implementations of Genetic Algorithms, a powerful optimization technique inspired by natural evolution, and observe their effectiveness in solving various optimization tasks.

- **Usage and Experimentation**: Each function and algorithm is accompanied by usage examples and guidelines, empowering you to experiment, modify, and analyze their performance.

## Getting Started

To dive into the world of objective functions and Genetic Algorithms, simply clone this repository and explore the provided implementations. Follow the usage instructions in each module's documentation to understand how to use and experiment with different functions and algorithms.

Feel free to contribute by adding new objective functions, enhancing existing implementations, or sharing your insights into optimizing the algorithms further.
